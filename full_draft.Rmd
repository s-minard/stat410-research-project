## Introduction

As of 2021, 70% of the world’s population, or 5.4 billion people, live under an autocratic regime (Boese et al., 2022). Autocracies are a form of government “by a single person or small group that has unlimited power or authority” (Cambridge University Press & Assessment, n.d.), and they often arise from populist movements. Populism is an exclusionary, anti-elitist, anti-pluralist political ideology based on the idea that the “true people” are under threat from some kind of elite enemy, be it an economic, political, racial, or foreign one (Berlin et al., 1968). The ideology can fuel support for autocratic leaders who persuade the public that only they can protect them from perceived enemies, thus justifying the consolidation of executive power without accountability (Al Waroi et al., 2024; Baturo et al., 2024). Donald Trump’s populist messaging has galvanized many Americans against a variety of perceived enemies, including racial and gender minorities, immigrants, and other vaguely defined “elites.” Since regaining the presidency in 2025, Trump has taken steps to consolidate his power and remove checks and balances, thus bringing the United States closer to an authoritarian autocracy– and many Americans wholeheartedly support this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to understand the factors associated with support for autocratic leadership among Americans.

Populist movements and the autocratic leaders they support are often fueled by anxiety and subjective perceptions of economic insecurity, irrespective of whether objective measures of hardship are present (Gidron & Hall, 2017). In other words, actual economic insecurity is not necessary, only the perception of insecurity. Moreover, it is the perception of economic insecurity at the macro level that significantly predicts these attitudes, not at the micro level (Watson et al., 2021). Severe real-world threats can be especially impactful in this regard. For example, through their analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic downturn in Italy, Rocatto et al. (2020) found that times of uncertainty and hardship can drive people toward anti-democratic, authoritarian, and autocratic leaders because they offer a restored sense of control over their social world. Given that a recent Pew Research Center poll found Americans’ current economic ratings to be predominantly negative (Cerda, 2025), it is important to test the relationship between subjective economic insecurity and anti-democratic sentiment in the US. Therefore, our first research question is as follows: *How does perceived macro level economic insecurity relate to support for autocratic leadership?*

As the information channels American society relies on continue to evolve, it is important to consider the relationship between media type preferences and anti-democratic sentiments that encourage support for autocratic leadership. Notably, mainstream media trust among conservatives has declined, leading them to seek alternatives like social media, where they may encounter misinformation and populist rhetoric (Hutchens et al., 2025; Mourão, 2017). While social media has been touted as a democratic panacea because of its potential for disseminating anti-regime information and mobilizing collective action, many autocratic regimes engage in social media censorship (Gunitsky, 2015). However, Gunitsky (2015) argues that many regimes have since moved from suppression to co-optation of social media as a tool to maintain autocratic stability– a far more insidious tactic. Co-opting social media allows autocratic regimes to shape the discourse on social media, promote counter-mobilization, and bolster regime legitimacy. Given autocratic co-optation alongside the transition to social media as the public’s primary source of news and information, it is crucial to investigate the relationship between social media use and support for autocratic governance among American adults. Furthermore, the disparity in media preferences between conservatives and liberals means that political ideology must be considered as a mediating factor in this relationship. As a result, we propose the following research question: *Is a preference for getting news and information primarily from social media associated with support for autocratic leadership? How does this relationship vary depending on political ideology?*

By investigating these research questions, this paper will contribute to our understanding of the factors associated with support for autocratic leadership among Americans. First, we hypothesize that higher perceived macro level economic insecurity is associated with support for autocratic leadership. Second, we hypothesize that there is a stronger relationship between the preference for getting news and information primarily from social media and support for autocratic leadership among conservatives compared to liberals.

## Methods

### Data Collection
This study conducts secondary analysis of the American Trends Panel Wave 124 data set from Pew Research Center, also known as ATP Wave 124. The survey was administered to a nationally representative, stratified random sample of U.S. adults from March 20 to March 26, 2023. Of the 4,058 panelists sampled, 3,576 responded, resulting in a response rate of 88%. Hispanic men, non-Hispanic Black men, and non-Hispanic Asian were oversampled then weighted to provide more precise estimates. 

### Variable Creation

The primary dependent variable in this study is support for autocratic leadership, which was measured through the following question: “Would each of the following political systems be a good or bad way of governing this country? A system in which a strong leader can make decisions without interference from Congress or the courts.” Response options included a range from “Very good” to “Very bad,” and “Refused.” This was re-coded into “Supports” and “Does not support" to ensure a binary response variable. 

Independent variables we considered included demographics such as age, race, gender, and family income. In addition, we used economic perception (“How would you describe the current economic situation in the U.S.?”) to measure perceived economic insecurity at the macro level. Categories were collapsed into “Good” and “Bad.” Finally, multiple variables measured respondents’ news source and social media preferences, including how often respondents get news, facts, and opinions about issues or events from social media sites, and whether respondents prefer getting various kinds of information from news outlets, social media, both, or neither. The five variables concerning whether respondents preferred news outlets or social media were re-coded to contain three levels (2: “Prefers social media”;  1: “Prefers both”; and 0: “Prefers news outlets or neither”). Then, the values for each were summed within each row to assign an index score for social media preference to each respondent. With a range of 0-10, higher scores indicated a stronger preference for obtaining information from social media. For all variables, “Refused” responses were treated as “NA” and dropped. The final sample size included in the model was 2065 observations.

### Analytical Methods

Frequency tables were used to summarize the counts and proportions for control variables including income, race, gender, and political party categories. They were also used to summarize the response and some explanatory variables. The social media preference index score distribution for each autocratic support category was illustrated with ridgelines and boxplots. Multiple logistic regression was used to predict support for autocratic leadership. We included the aforementioned theory-driven variables as well as income, race ("White" or "Non-White"), gender, and political leaning in the final model. Control variables were refined through stepwise selection, which removed only age. 

## Results

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Figure 1 shows that social media preference index score distributions are similar between those who do and do not support autocratic leadership. However, the supportive group's mean score (3.672) was marginally higher than the non-supportive group's (3.510).

Figure 2 displays the proportions of respondents who support autocratic leadership within each economic perception category, faceted by political leaning. Across all political groups, a higher proportion of those who perceive the economy as "good" express support for autocracy. Frequency tables for income, political party, race, gender, and economic perception are included in the appendix.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals' social media reliance and perception of the economy as generally good or bad might predict support for autocratic leadership in the United States. In addition, an interaction between social media reliance and political ideology is also considered. There is very strong evidence that at least one variable in the model with social media preference index score, social media use frequency, economic perception, gender, race, political leaning, income, and the social media preference-political leaning interaction has predictive power of autocratic support (G = 141.3424, p-value < 0.001). However, the model overall is a poor fit, as evidenced by the AUC value (AUC = 0.6589). 

Several predictors were statistically significant, including the intercept (z = -1.978, p-value = 0.0479), perceiving the econoomy as good (z = 4.009, p-value < 0.0001), being a woman (z = 2.100, p-value = 0.0357), being white (z = -5.475, p-value < 0.00001), being or leaning Republican (z = 2.371, p-value = 0.0177), being middle income (z = -6.309, p-value < 0.00001), and being upper income (z = -8.011, p-value < 0.00001). Social media preference index score, social media use frequency, being non-binary, being neither Republican nor Democrat, and the interaction between social media preference index score and political leaning were not statistically significant.

In the code chunk below, we create the first model with all demographic and theory-driven variables under consideration. We then check the ROC curve.
```{r}
#| label: model-v1
#| eval: false

#creating the first model using all theory-driven variables AND all demographic/control variables
autoc_lm_v1 <- glm(autoc_support ~ sm_pref_index + sm_freq + factor(econ_percep) + factor(age) + factor(gender) + factor(race_1) + factor(pol_lean)  + factor(pol_lean)*sm_pref_index + factor(income), family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = amertrends_clean)
summary(autoc_lm_v1)

#ROC curve for v1
#predicted probabilities
predicted_probs_v1 <- predict(autoc_lm_v1, type = "response")
#actual outcomes
actual_outcomes_v1 <- autoc_lm_v1$y
#ROC plot and AUC
roc_v1 <- roc(actual_outcomes_v1, predicted_probs_v1)
plot(roc_v1, legacy.axes = TRUE, main = "ROC Curve for autoc_lm_v1", 
     col = "blue", xlab = "False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity)", 
     ylab = "True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)")
auc(roc_v1)

#not a great model, so we will try adjusting which demographic variables are included to see if that improves things
```

In the code chunk below, we use stepwise selection to find the "best" model. Because the variable selection is partly theory-driven, we make the smaller model include the theory-driven variables to ensure they are included in the final model, rather than setting the lower model to a null model. The process results in a model that includes every predictor except age.  We then check the ROC curve and find that it is not much better or worse than the previous model. Given the stepwise results and the fact that all age categories were insignificant per the Wald-z tests, we decide to proceed with the model without age. There appears to be collinearity between the interaction term sm_pref_index*pol_lean and pol_lean.

In the code chunk below, we create the summary table for the final mode. It doesn't appear in the rendered word document unfortunately, so we include a screenshot in the text instead.
