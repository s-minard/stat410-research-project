## Abstract

This is not an example of a full Final Project! The purpose of this document is to show you some useful formatting options for R Markdown. Note I can change the size of my section headers based on how many # I put. 

## Introduction

I put my introduction here.

## Results

In my results section, I might want to put some graphics! I am actually creating my graphics in the Appendix. After creating and saving the graphs, I can reference the .png files in this section to print the image. 

In this section, I might want to create a table. Here is a small example. 

Parameter | Estimate | p-value
---------|---------|---------
Intercept | -76.64 | <.0001

I might want to insert an image that I generated previously in my appendix. 
![This is the caption!](myplot.png)

I can also insert an image via an R code chunk. If I do it thi way, I need to be sure to suppress the code from printing! 
```{r  echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("myplot.png")
```



# References

# Appendix of All R Code

Read in the data and create an example graphic to put in our paper. We want the knitted file to show code and output. 
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(car)
data(Davis) #found in the car package

#clean names
davis <- Davis %>%
  clean_names()

#Just view the first couple of rows of data
head(davis) 

#variable information
str(davis)
```


There is an obvious outlier and after some investigation, we see it is row 12.  Therefore, we want to remove that data point from our analysis (this is most likely a data entry error as there would not be someone who is less than 60 cm in real life, or at least not an adult).
```{r}
```


Let's use some new arguments in `ggformula` to look at our data, but split by sex.
```{r}
#remove an outlier and create a plot
new_davis<-davis[-12,] #removes row 12 from the dataframe

#including sex in the model, outlier removed
gf_point(weight~height, shape = ~sex, color = ~sex, data=new_davis, xlab="Height (cm)", ylab="Weight (kg)") %>%
  gf_lm() 
```
Now we want to save this graph so we can insert it earlier in our paper. 

```{r}
#by default this saves the last graph you created. you can change the width or height (inches)
ggsave("myplot.png", width=5, height=2.5)
```

After I run this code once to save the graph, THEN I can go back to the top of my document and insert the image. 

```{r}
#Run the model, view coefficients and hypothesis tests
model<-lm(weight~height+factor(sex), data=new_davis)

```
